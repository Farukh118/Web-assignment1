# Web-assignment1
This is a straightforward backend-only To-Do List app built with Node.js and Express.js as part of a Web Programming practical. It offers three API endpoints for managing tasks: adding, viewing, and deleting. Tasks are stored in-memory using a JavaScript array (without a database). The API routes include: POST /addTask to create a task (requires a JSON body with taskName), GET /tasks to fetch all tasks, and DELETE /task/:id to delete a task by its ID. The app runs on http://localhost:3000. API functionality is tested using Postman, with screenshots of all three operations (POST, GET, DELETE) included. This project is lightweight and a great way to learn how to build RESTful APIs with Express.
# Flollow these steps to Run:

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org.

In your terminal, install the required dependencies, such as Express.

Use Postman to test the API at http://localhost:3000.
